            After Northwestern moved our servers from one campus to the other recently our Blast from the Front - and all Gene Pages, as well as the Genome Browser (including snapshot on gene page) are down. We and Northwestern IT staff are working on the problem. Meanwhile for Blast use the Genome Server, the Blast server which is available from the other genome sites we house. Thanks for your patience!
