        Why axenic strains grow by fluid uptake: We have added the axeB gene to Chromosome 3 at the locus which is largely deleted in axenic strains and thus responsible for their ability to grow axenically. Only an axeB 3' fragment could be generated on the AX4 genome assembly. The full length gene in non-axenic strains such as DdB codes for the conserved neurofibromin 1, a RasGAP, which has been shown to be involved in macropinocytosis and phagocytosis. For more information, see Bloomfield et al.
